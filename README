TCS check
=========

Small script used at KTH to check for name changes for users that 
have access to TCS personal och e-science certificates.

Added here if other universities find it useful.

Short description
=================

We have all our users in a central database (own system) and data is 
propagated to ldap where this script gets its information. We have 
and ldap group where all the users are members and that is the group
we check against. If you have the group membership as a memberof 
attribute you will have to change the questions (we have that in an 
other ldap but this one is easier to use for this).

This script should be run from cron like:

    MAILTO=tcs-revoke@your.domain.tld
    5 9 * * 1-5     cd /path/to/files/tcs && . .env/bin/activate && ./tcs.py -v

That will update the database with new users and validate the information 
for old ones.

The report will look like the following when everything is ok:


   Report for TCS
   ==============

   Nothing to report.

   End of report


If a user is still in the group but no longer has the right affiliation:


   Report for TCS
   ==============

   User: u17xyu9v now have affiliation other.

   End of report


Action:
0. Check with user
1. Remove from ldap/UG group
2. Remove from database:
    
    cd /path/to/files/tcs && . .env/bin/activate && ./tcs.py -r u17xyu9v

3. Revoke cert (code to come)

If a user has been removed from the group that are allowed to get certs:


   Report for TCS
   ==============

   User: u17xyu9v is no longer in the group.

   End of report

Same as aboive for changed affiliation.

If a user changed name:

    Report for TCS
    ==============

    User: u17xyu9v has changed name. In UG: Bash User, Test and in DB: Bash, Test

    End of report

0. Check with user
1. Update database:
    
    cd /path/to/files/tcs && . .env/bin/activate && ./tcs.py -u u17xyu9v

3. Revoke cert (code to come)
4. User gets new cert


TODO
====

* Better argmunent handling. Just switched to argparse and haven't had 
  time to look at it.
